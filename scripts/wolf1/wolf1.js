<h1>Wolves as pets and working animals</h1>
<hr>
  <p>Wolves are sometimes kept as exotic pets,
   and in some rarer occasions, as working animals. 
   Although closely related to domesticated dogs, wolves
   do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside 
   humans, and generally, a greater amount of effort is required in order 
   to obtain the same amount of reliability. Wolves also need much more space than dogs,
   about 25 to 40 square kilometres (10 to 15 sq mi) so they can exercise.</p>
