<h1>Temperament<h1>
<hr>
<p>Captive wolves are generally shy and avoid eye contact with humans other than their owner,
 as well as not listening to any commands made by any other humans. They usually vacate rooms or 
 hide when a new person enters the establishment. Even seemingly friendly wolves need to be treated
 with caution, as captive wolves tend to view and treat people as other wolves, and will thus bite or 
 dominate people in the same situation
 in which they would other wolves.</p>
 <h1>Trainability<h1>
 <hr>
 <p>Though wolves are trainable, they lack the same degree of tractability seen in dogs. They are generally 
 not as responsive as dogs to coercive techniques involving fear, aversion to stimuli, and force. Generally,
  far more work is required to obtain the same degree of reliability seen in most dogs. Even then, once a 
  certain behavior has been repeated several times, wolves may get bored and ignore subsequent commands. 
  Wolves are most responsive toward positive conditioning and rewards, though simple praise is not sufficient 
  as in most dogs.  Unlike dogs, wolves tend to respond more to hand signals than voice. Although they are
   more difficult to control than dogs, they can be easier to teach if the 
   motivation exists.

   <h1>Rearing</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Captive wolf puppies are usually taken from their mother at the age of 
        14 days, preferably no later than 21 days. Wolf pups require more socialisation than dog pups, 
        and will typically stop responding to socialisation at the age of 19 days, as opposed to dogs which can
         still be socialised at the age of 16 weeks. For the first four months of their lives, wolf pups need to 
         be kept isolated from adult canines, except for a few brief visits per week, in order for them to properly 
         imprint on humans. Pups will typically develop behavioural abnormalities if raised without another
          member of their own kind. Because wolf milk contains more arginine than can be found in puppy
           milk substitutes, an arginine supplement is needed when 
        feeding pups below the weaning age. Failure to do so can result in the pups developing cataracts.</p>
